1
00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.700
<v Speaker1>A raspy sound at low revs,
metallic at high revs.

2
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.070
<v Speaker1>The furious sound of an engine that can rev
up to 9000 rpm.

3
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.550
<v Speaker1>An ambiance you can only hear
in this machine.

4
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.270
<v Speaker1>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard
the new 911 GT3 RS.

5
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.500
<v Speaker1>Of course. You know the Porsche 911, the
sports car you can use every day.

6
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.060
<v Speaker1>And then there's the 911 GT3, the one that bridges
the gap between road and track.

7
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.890
<v Speaker1>Well, the GT3 RS pushes the boundaries even
further, much further indeed.

8
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.960
<v Speaker1>But then, what does it offer beyond a
GT3?

9
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.280
<v Speaker1>And to test this ultimate evolution of the
GT3 RS, Porsche takes us to a track

10
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.000
<v Speaker1>of legend, where all super sports cars
measure themselves against each other.

11
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.740
<v Speaker1>The Nürburgring in Germany.

12
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.040
<v Speaker1>It's perfect, this 911 is designed to
devour the track.

13
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.290
<v Speaker1>It's said to be the driver's 911.

14
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.790
<v Speaker1>You'll see why in this review.

15
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.500
<v Speaker1>And what sets a GT3 apart from a
GT3?

16
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:10.940
<v Speaker1>You may ask about the RS?

17
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.840
<v Speaker1>Well, it's all these
aerodynamic features you see before you.

18
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.870
<v Speaker1>Like these air intakes on the front hood.

19
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.890
<v Speaker1>It's new on this GT3 RS, they
are directly inherited from the big sister

20
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:22.910
<v Speaker1>GT2 RS.

21
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.570
<v Speaker1>These are what we call NACA intakes and
they're solely for cooling the brakes.

22
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.140
<v Speaker1>The advantage is that they leave
other air intakes free

23
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.560
<v Speaker1>to create even more aerodynamic downforce
than on the previous version.

24
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.760
<v Speaker1>As a result, this new GT3 RS is
literally glued to the asphalt.

25
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.010
<v Speaker1>Front splitter, air intake, massive wing,
On this GT3 RS, nothing is there

26
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.510
<v Speaker1>for no reason. Everything has a function.

27
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.790
<v Speaker1>All these aerodynamic features come from
Porsche's racing experience.

28
00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.080
<v Speaker1>The result is a car planted on the ground with a
jaw-dropping appearance.

29
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.660
<v Speaker1>Inside this GT3?

30
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.610
<v Speaker1>RS Once again, nothing is there by chance.

31
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.110
<v Speaker1>Alcantara on the steering wheel for example,
It's nice, but it mainly prevents your hands from

32
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.660
<v Speaker1>slipping, ultra-wrapping carbon bucket seats
from the Porsche 918 supercar

33
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.890
<v Speaker1>Spyder. It's flashy, but it will mainly allow you
to perfectly connect

34
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.110
<v Speaker1>with the machine. In short, you're on board
a well-thought-out, maximally lightened

35
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.060
<v Speaker1>and ultra-functional competition 911.

36
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.470
<v Speaker1>But then what does this new
GT3 RS bring?

37
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.150
<v Speaker1>Its engine has gained 20 horsepower compared to
its predecessor, reaching 520 horsepower and

38
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.900
<v Speaker1>now it's only available with the
seven-speed PDK robotized gearbox.

39
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:49.430
<v Speaker1>Okay, I hear you, already 520 horsepower,
that's not that much in the end. And it's true, you're right.

40
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.260
<v Speaker1>Many sports cars are more powerful
nowadays.

41
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.090
<v Speaker1>Yes, it's true, but none in its
category is as light.

42
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.230
<v Speaker1>Only 1430 kilos on the scales.

43
00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.720
<v Speaker1>So, it goes fast.

44
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.130
<v Speaker1>Very fast indeed. Especially since the PDK gearbox
has been reworked to shift even faster.

45
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:07.450
<v Speaker1>Listen to this.
The gears shift in bursts, the accelerations take your breath away.

46
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.980
<v Speaker1>As a result, the 0 to 100 kilometers per hour is
crushed in three point two seconds.

47
00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.070
<v Speaker1>The top speed peaks at 312 kilometers per hour on the track,
with all the aerodynamic features

48
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.180
<v Speaker1>in addition to the work done
on the chassis of this new 911 GT3 RS

49
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.590
<v Speaker1>which further stiffens its suspension,
offer it handling that reaches peaks.

50
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.940
<v Speaker1>This machine is of staggering precision.

51
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.950
<v Speaker1>The most difficult thing with this car
is to meet its demands.

52
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.610
<v Speaker1>It's so precise that it demands
the same rigor from you on the track.

53
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.950
<v Speaker1>Even better, it scans it and
transmits you an incredible amount of information

54
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.270
<v Speaker1>with a finesse that only a Porsche
can achieve.

55
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.500
<v Speaker1>If you can exploit what it transmits,
then believe me, no one can follow you.

56
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.640
<v Speaker1>However, any mistake on your part
will be paid for dearly.

57
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.090
<v Speaker1>Of course, this 911 GT3 RS
is capable of driving on the road,

58
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.960
<v Speaker1>but this precision that you love on the track
will quickly tire you on degraded roads.

59
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.100
<v Speaker1>Faster than a Mercedes AMG GTR, this GT3 RS
is a pure track machine.

60
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.440
<v Speaker1>It's not just its engine, its fabulous engine, its ultra-fast gearbox,

61
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.160
<v Speaker1>and its more dynamic chassis that make it
the most formidable sports car of the moment.

62
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.460
<v Speaker1>Completely addictive pleasure.

63
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:24.920
<v Speaker1>Priced very high at €198,335.

64
00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.580
<v Speaker1>But excellence comes with a price.

65
00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.370
<v Speaker1>A completely addictive pleasure.

66
00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.820
<v Speaker1>Priced very high at €198,335.

67
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:35.900
<v Speaker1>But excellence comes with a price.
